I'm a former software tester with a year of experience in the IT industry and a certified ISEB-ISTQB tester. As a software tester, I have a good eye for detail,
analytical and problem solving skills using which I would now like to build things through coding. I want to be a part of an innovative products development in which
I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack software development and design.


## Skills

#### Analysis

I have worked on analyzing data generated from execution of automated scripts to understand the particular behaviour of an application.
Ability to analyze the given business situation and judge all the possible scenarios.


#### Communication

Having worked in an ERP sector there were situations where in I had to be the bridge between development and functional experts,
this provided with an opportunity to query the functional process and question the developer. I was exposed to working in a cross
module structure which demanded crisp and clear knowledge sharing between the team members where in interdependencies had to be
communicated to other team members and developers through frequent presentations.
