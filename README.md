I'm an enthusiastic Full Stack Software Developer, who has had an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in the world of coding through Makers Academy's 16-week programming course.
I have learnt TDD to write better code and the skill to rapidly pick up new languages and frameworks.

As a former software tester with a year of experience in the IT industry and a certified ISEB-ISTQB tester, I have a good eye for details, analytical and problem solving skills using which I would now like to develop and design solutions that would change people's lives for the better. I'm most productive when working with passionate technologists in an encouraging environment. I'm looking for somewhere I can learn more and build on the TDD and Agile practices in software development.

## Skills

#### Analysis

I have worked on analyzing data generated from execution of automated scripts to understand the particular behaviour of an application.
Ability to analyze the given business situation and judge all the possible scenarios.


#### Communication

Having worked in an ERP sector there were situations where in I had to be the bridge between development and functional experts,
this provided with an opportunity to query the functional process and question the developer. I was exposed to working in a cross
module structure which demanded crisp and clear knowledge sharing between the team members where in interdependencies had to be
communicated to other team members and developers through frequent presentations.
